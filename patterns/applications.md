# Applications

# Real world applications of graphs

## Optimization problems

- Algorithms like Dijkstra's enable your navigation system / GPS to decide which
  roads you should drive on to reach a destination;

- The Hungarian Algorithm can assign each Uber car to people looking for a ride
  (an assignment problem);

- Chess, Checkers, Go and Tic-Tac-Toe are formulated as a game tree (a
  degenerate graph) and can be "solved" using brute-force depth or breadth first
  search, or using heuristics with minimax or A\*;

- Flow networks and algorithms like maximum flow can be used in modelling
  utilities networks (water, gas, electricity), roads, flight scheduling, supply
  chains;

## Network Topology

- The minimum spanning tree ensures that your internet traffic gets delivered
  even when cables break;

- Topological sort is used in project planning to decide which tasks should be
  executed first;

- Disjoint sets help you efficiently calculate currency conversions between NxN
  currencies in linear time;

- Graph coloring can in theory be used to decide which seats in a cinema should
  remain free during a infectious disease outbreak;

- Detecting strongly connected components helps uncover bot networks spreading
  misinformation on Facebook and Twitter;

- DAGs are used to perform very large computations distributed over thousands of
  machines in software like Apache Spark and Tensorflow;

## Specialized types of graphs

- Bayesian networks were used by NASA to select an operating system for the
  space shuttle;

- Neural networks are used in language translation, image synthesis (such as
  fake face generation), color recovery of black-and-white images, speech
  synthesis;
